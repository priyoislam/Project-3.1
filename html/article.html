            <p>We all know what research is. <b>It's the thing we do when we want to find something out.</b> It is what
                we are trained to do in a PhD program. It&#8217;s what comes before development.</p>
            <p>The wonderful people at define <em>research</em> as</p>
            <p><em><b> Noun: systematic investigation to establish facts; a search for knowledge.</b></em></p>
            <p><em><b> Verb: attempt to find out in a systematically and scientific manner; inquire into.</b></em> </p>
            <p>An etymologist might tell us that it comes from the Old French word <em>cerchier</em>, to
                <em>search</em>, with <em>re- </em>expressing intensive force. I guess it is saying that before 1400 in
                France, research meant to search really hard. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>If I was talking to a staff member at my university, though, I would say that searching hard was
                <em>scholarship</em>. The difference? Research has to have an element of discovering something new, of
                creating knowledge. While a literature search is one important part of a research project, it
                isn&#8217;t research in and of itself. It is scholarship.</p>
            <p>Don&#8217;t take my word for it. In Australian universities, we define research this way:</p> <b>
                <p>Research is defined as the creation of new knowledge and/or the use of existing knowledge in a new
                    and creative way so as to generate new concepts, methodologies and understandings. This could
                    include synthesis and analysis of previous research to the extent that it leads to new and creative
                    outcomes.</p>
                <p>This definition of research is consistent with a broad notion of research and experimental
                    development (R&amp;D) as comprising of creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to
                    increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of humanity, culture and society, and the use
                    of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications</p>
                <p>This definition of research encompasses pure and strategic basic research, applied research and
                    experimental development. Applied research is original investigation undertaken to acquire new
                    knowledge but directed towards a specific, practical aim or objective (including a client-driven
                    purpose).</p>
            </b>

                    collection of 2011 data</em>.</p>
            <h2>What research sounds like</h2>
            <p>Sometimes, however, you don&#8217;t want to talk about &#8216;Research<strong>&#8216;</strong>. If you
                are applying to a philanthropic foundation, for example, they may not be interested in your new
                knowledge so much as the impact that your work will have, your capacity to help them to solve a problem.
                Industry partners may also be wary of the &#8216;R&#8217; word. Don&#8217;t bank your business on
                someone&#8217;s PhD, they will say (and I would wholeheartedly agree).</p>
            <p>This creates something of a quandary, as the government gives us money based on how much research income
                we bring in. They audit our claims, so everything we say is research has to actually be research. So, it
                helps to flag it as research, even if you don&#8217;t say it explicitly.</p>
            <p>Instead, you might talk about <em>innovation</em>, or about <em>experimentation</em>. You could describe
                the element of <em>risk</em> associated with <em>discovery.</em><em>Investigation</em> might lead to
                <em>analysis</em>. There might be <em>tests</em> that you will undertake to <em>prove</em> your
                <em>hypothesis</em>. You could just say that this work is <em>original</em> and has never been done
                before. You could talk about what <em>new</em> <em>knowledge</em> your work will lead to. </p>
            <p>You might describe a new <em>method</em> or a new <em>data</em> source that will lead to a
                <em>breakthrough</em> or anincremental <em>improvement</em> over current practice. You could make it
                clear that it is the precursor to <em>development</em>, in the sense of &#8216;research and
                development&#8217;.</p>
            <p>It really helps if you are doing something <em>new</em>.</p>
            <h2>What research looks like</h2>
            <p>Sometimes, it isn&#8217;t what you say, but what you do. If your work will lead to a patent, book or book
                chapter, refereed journal article or conference publication, or an artwork or exhibition (in the case of
                creative outputs), then it almost always fulfills the definition no matter what you call it.</p>
            <h2>What research isn&#8217;t</h2>
            <p>Sometimes, you can see a thing more clearly by describing what it isn&#8217;t.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Research isn&#8217;t teaching.</strong></em> Don&#8217;t get me wrong. You can research
                teaching, just like you can research anything else. However, teaching itself is generally regarded as
                the synthesis and transfer of existing knowledge. Generally, the knowledge has to exist before you can
                teach it. Most of the time, you aren&#8217;t creating new knowledge as you teach. Some lecturers may
                find that their students create strange new &#8216;knowledge&#8217; in their assignments, but making
                stuff up doesn&#8217;t count as research either.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Research isn&#8217;t scholarship.</em></strong> As I said at the start, a literature search
                is an important aspect of the research process but it isn&#8217;t research in and of itself. Scholarship
                (the process of being a scholar) generally describes surveying existing knowledge. You might be looking
                for new results that you hadn&#8217;t read before, or you might be synthesizing the information for your
                teaching practice. Either way, you aren&#8217;t creating new knowledge, you are reviewing what already
                exists.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Research isn&#8217;t encyclopaedic.</strong></em> Encyclopedias, by and large, seek to
                present a synthesis of existing knowledge. Collecting and publishing existing knowledge isn&#8217;t
                research, as it doesn&#8217;t create new knowledge.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Research isn&#8217;t just data-gathering.</strong></em> Data-gathering is a vital part of
                research, but it doesn&#8217;t lead to new knowledge without some analysis, some further work. Just
                collecting the data doesn&#8217;t count, unless you do something else with it.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Research isn&#8217;t just about methodology.</strong></em> Just because you are using mice,
                or interviewing people, or using a High Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) doesn&#8217;t mean you
                are doing research. You might be, if you are using a new data set or using the method in a new way or
                testing a new hypothesis. However, if you are using the same method, on the same data, exploring the
                same question, then you will almost certainly get the same results. And that is repetition, not
                research.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Research isn&#8217;t repetition, except in some special circumstances.</strong></em> If you
                are doing the same thing that someone else has already done, then generally that isn&#8217;t research
                <strong>unless</strong> you are specifically trying to prove or disprove their work. What&#8217;s the
                difference? Repeating an experiment from 1400 isn&#8217;t research. You know what the result will be
                before your start. It has already been verified many times before. Repeating an experiment reported last
                year probably is research because the original result can&#8217;t be relied upon until it is verified.
            </p>
            <p>Is development research? Development (as in &#8216;research and development&#8217;) may or may not be
                classified as research, depending on the type of risk involved. Sometimes, the two are inextricably
                linked: the research leads to the development and the development refines the research. At other times,
                you are creating something new, but it is a new product or process, not new knowledge. It is based on
                new knowledge, rather than creating new knowledge. If the risk involved is a business risk, rather than
                intellectual risk, then the knowledge is already known.</p>
            <p>Help me out here. What are your favourite words that signal research?</p>
