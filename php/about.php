            <p class="card-text cardclr1">Our site provides an organised set of ideas on research.Beginners may get help
              from it.A collection of curated and hosted full-text publications from select publishers will ease the path
              of research.Diffeent types of blogs,journels,papers are decorated alphabetically which may generate
              productivity.IT depends on the research but generally; because a scientist will first come up with a theory,
              then he and everyone else will do everything in their power to prove it wrong.

              If, after sometimes hundreds or thousands of tests, the theory stands true, it becomes widly accepted as
              reliable.

                    A research study is a defined effort by doctors and scientists to investigate a research question.
                    This effort includes the functions of study design, implementation, measurement and reporting.

                    Most research is funded by taxpayer dollars through government grants, such as the National Institutes
                    of Health (cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, etc.), private companies, and nonprofit foundation
                    grants, such as the National Kidney Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

                    there are a number of questions you might ask before deciding if a research study is right for you.

                    Why were you invited to join the research study?
                    What is the purpose of the research? What is the study trying to find out?
                    What are the risks and benefits of participating in the study?
                    What are the alternatives to being in the study?

                    Registries help link volunteers to specific studies by collecting information about the specific
                    disease or condition a volunteer is interested in along with their medical history, age, gender,
                    contact information, etc. Since this information is personal, you will want to know who is sponsoring
                    the registry and how your information is used and protected.

                    You may volunteer for any study appropriate to your condition. However, each research study has strict
                    eligibility requirements. The investigator (physician or other medical professional who runs the
                    study) will make sure you meet these requirements before accepting you in the study.
